Flask
Does not contain user management 
Database connectivity - No MVC by Default 
LightWeight

Django 
Pre-Built WebApp Framework 
Model View Controller Architecture setup simply from "django-admin startproject myDjangoSite"
mysite/
    manage.py
    mysite/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        asgi.py
        wsgi.py

Where as with flask, nothing is really created. 
We create the pages from scratch



if __name__ == "__main__":
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/toplevel_components.html#complete-python-programs 
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html?highlight=__name__#__name__

In a brief nutshell it is a requirement in order to kick start the python compiler, establish required resources
and recognize that a program is being requested to run.


You typically see this at the bottom and the actual functions and methods above. 
This is because methods and functions must be defined before they are run. 

If you find this at the top of the code then it will execute immediatly without your methods being defined and established

Example from our S3 Flask App
@app.route("/download/<filename>", methods=['GET'])
def download(filename):
    if request.method == 'GET':
        output = download_file(filename, BUCKET)

        return send_file(output, as_attachment=True)


if __name__ == '__main__':
     app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=True)


If main was run before def download, the application would have no recognition of def download. 
So similarly to variables being instantiated before execution or implementation into methods and functions
